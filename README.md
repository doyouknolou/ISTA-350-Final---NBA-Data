# ISTA-350-Final---NBA-Data

I chose NBA 2021 Playoff Data. I am a Phoenix Suns fans so I found it to be a pretty good series until game 6 where we lost. I will look at scores of different teams and see if the teams who on average scored the most made it further in the playoffs. In my opinion I belive the NBA playoffs to be the most fair finals competition as each team plays a 7 game series. Meaning, there are 7 games first team to reach 4 wins, wins the series, and advances to next the game in the playoffs. It is broken down by player so I am also curious to comapre players head to head. I am most interested in Devin Booker and Giannis Antetokounmpo as they are pretty much the stars of their teams. I may also look look at a Nikola Jokic comparison as he was voted MVP last year.
